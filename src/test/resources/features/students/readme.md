Students

The students are the main reason to MyFictitious Course Center provide all this structure to allow
they take courses. The students have mainly autonomy to handle personal data and handle their participation
in the courses.

A student has the following roles:
- Request to enroll into a course;
- Request to suspend a course participation;
- Request to cancel a course participation;
- Request a report for the courses the student is enrolled;
- Request a report about the grades for its courses.
